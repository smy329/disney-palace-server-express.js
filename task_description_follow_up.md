## **Optional (But Highly Recommended):**

1. Implement a JWT token in your routes.

<br/>

2. Add a spinner when the data is in a loading state. You can add a gif/jpg, use any package or customize it using CSS.

<br/>

3. **Interesting part:**

   > Each blog will contain a question, an answer, and a pin icon. You can display them however you want. When a user clicks on a pin icon, the pin icon will become blue (or any dark color), and the pinned blog will be shown on the homepage. However, if a user clicks on the already pinned blog, the blog will be unpinned, and that blog will not appear on the homepage. Make sure to make the pin icon white when the blog unpins.
   > <br/>
   > When a user is not logged in, the pin button is disabled.

<br/>

4. **Little Bit Advanced:** Add more toys for each sub-category. You can add pagination in your tab system.

<br/>

5. Add extra features of your own. This will help you in the future to differentiate your project from others.

### **Additional information:**

1. You can use a local or host image anywhere or use pictures from the internet. And it's ok if you have the image url, but the image link doesn't work.
2. You can use vanilla CSS or any CSS library (Bootstrap, tailwind) you want. If you wish, you can use both Bootstrap and react-bootstrap. Also, if you want, you can use any tailwind component library such as DaisyUI, etc.
3. Try to host your site on Firebase (Netlify hosting will need some extra configurations)
4. Host your server-side application on Vercel. If needed, you can host somewhere else as well.
5. Make Sure you deploy server-side and client-side on the first day. If you have any issues with hosting or GitHub push, please join the "Github and deploy" related support session.

### **Some Guidelines:**

1. Do not waste much time on the website idea. Just spend 15-20 minutes deciding, find a sample website, and start working on it.
2. Do not waste much time finding the right image. You can always start with a simple idea. Make the website and then add different images.
3. Don't look at the overall task list. Just take one task at a time and do it. Once it's done, pick the next task. If you get stuck on a particular task, move on to the next task.
4. Stay calm, think before coding, and work sequentially. You will make it.
5. Be strategic about the electricity issue.
6. use `chatgpt` to generate JSON data. You can use chatGPT for Yother purposes as well.
